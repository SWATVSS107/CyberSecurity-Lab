Nmap-Based Network Security Analysis Using Machine Learning
1. Project Overview

This project focuses on defining a machine learning problem in the domain of cybersecurity using network scan data generated by Nmap. The aim is to analyze port and service information obtained from Nmap scans and formulate a structured ML problem that can assist in identifying potentially vulnerable network configurations.

The work is carried out as part of a Cyber Security Lab experiment and emphasizes problem definition, data requirements, assumptions, feasibility, and impact analysis.

2. Problem Statement

Develop a machine learning model that analyzes Nmap scan results to classify network ports and services as safe or potentially vulnerable, enabling faster security assessment and proactive risk mitigation.

3. Domain Description

Network security involves identifying open ports, running services, and misconfigurations that may expose systems to cyber threats.
Nmap is a widely used network scanning tool that provides detailed information about:

Open and closed ports

Network protocols

Running services and versions

Manual analysis of such scan results is time-consuming. Machine learning can help automate this process by learning patterns associated with insecure configurations.

4. Dataset Description
4.1 Data Source

The dataset is self-generated using Nmap scans.

Scans are performed only on:

Localhost

Virtual machines

Authorized lab systems

Nmap scan data is sufficient to represent basic network security posture

Lab-generated data reflects real-world configurations

6.2 Constraints

Limited dataset size

Scanning restricted to authorized systems

No real exploit execution involved

6.3 Ethical Considerations

Only authorized systems are scanned

No personal or sensitive data is collected

Experiment is conducted in a controlled environment

7. Feasibility and Impact
7.1 Feasibility

Nmap provides structured and reliable scan output

Lightweight ML models such as Decision Trees or Logistic Regression can be applied

Dataset generation is fully controlled and reproducible

7.2 Impact
